# EA Super 8

EA Super 8 is an expert advisor designed for automated trading in the Forex market. This code serves as a sample implementation of the EA Super 8 strategy.

## Strategy

The EA Super 8 strategy is based on two trading strategies - Strategy 1 and Strategy 2. The expert advisor analyzes the current market conditions and determines the trend direction. Depending on the trend direction and the validity of the respective strategy, the expert advisor opens buy or sell trades.

### Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the necessary parameters and variables are set. The account balance is obtained using the `AccountInfoDouble()` function. The risk percentage is set to 10% of the account balance per trade. The risk amount is calculated by multiplying the account balance by the risk percentage and dividing it by 10. The lot size is then calculated by dividing the risk amount by 1000. The maximum number of trades is calculated by dividing the account balance by the risk amount. The minimum profit per trade is calculated by dividing the account balance by the maximum number of trades. The current trend direction is obtained using the `GetTrendDirection()` function. If the trend is up and Strategy 1 is valid, a buy trade is opened. If the trend is down and Strategy 2 is valid, a sell trade is opened.

### Tick Function

In the `OnTick()` function, trades with minimum profit are closed using the `CloseTradesWithMinimumProfit()` function.

### Trend Direction

The `GetTrendDirection()` function is responsible for determining the direction of the trend. The logic to determine the trend direction should be added to this function. It should return `TREND_UP` if the trend is up, `TREND_DOWN` if the trend is down, or `TREND_NONE` if no trend is detected.

### Strategy Validation

The `IsStrategy1Valid()` and `IsStrategy2Valid()` functions are used to check the validity of Strategy 1 and Strategy 2, respectively. The logic to check the validity of each strategy should be added to these functions. They should return `true` if the respective strategy is valid, and `false` otherwise.

### Closing Trades

The `CloseTradesWithMinimumProfit()` function loops through all open trades and checks if each trade meets the minimum profit requirement. If a trade meets the requirement, it is closed.
